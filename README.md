# Travel Time Optimization: Emergency Respondent Routing under Variable Hazardous Conditions
Alex E. Rodriguez, Dr. Stephen Medeiros

Objective: Emergency response teams must react quickly to a number of unforeseen events occurring at many locations within their service area. Using a Monte-Carlo simulation framework, this project analyzed the variability in travel time from the Orange County Fire Station to four strategic locations on the UCF campus.
