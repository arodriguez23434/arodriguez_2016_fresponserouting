Updates:
- Slightly modified calc_fuel_cost to be more a representative placeholder
- Weight calculations reworked to now use time and fuel as the two primary considerations
  > Fuel costs now calculated each iteration alongside time
  > Added 'fuel' and 'fuel_list' as NetworkX edge attributes
  > Road obstructions now add a large set weight value
- Added function relationshipGraphSetup
  > Sets up 5 seperate graphs displaying correlation between each input variable and weight, fuel and weight, and fuel and time
  > Calculates and displays best-fit line equation
  > Currently disregards cases where the best path was through an obstructed road
  > Modified main_matrix_model accordingly to display these graphs
- Modified log_2016_8-1.txt format to be in-line with previous logs

Todo:
- Update NetTestFor variables to adapt to reworked weight calculations
  > Update inputs.txt accordingly to any changes made
- Find cleaner, less code-pasting method for relationshipGraphSetup function
- Revise and finalize research letter
- Revise and finalize abstract for EXCEL
- Finish Todos from log_2016_7-13
