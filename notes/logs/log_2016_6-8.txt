Updates:
 - Added Python 3.4 virtual environment files for usage/testing consistency
 - Experimented with NetworkX functions (test_networkx_undir_graph.py)
   > Created simple model for obtaining shortest path for series of connected nodes
   > Model outputs graph and highlights path in red

Issues:
 - Configuration is inconsistently placed
 - No commenting/documentation
 - Source file is placed within environment rather than outside
 - Outdated folders require re-organization
