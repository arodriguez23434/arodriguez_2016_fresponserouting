Updates:
 - Reorganized notes folder to seperate logs from misc. notes
 - Added logs that were previously missing from 6-8-16 and 6-14-16
 - Renamed notes to be more clear about their contents
 - Added overview of robust model
 - Updated .gitignore to include .pyc
 - Updated robust network model
   > Fixed issue with path calculation (NetworkX requires 'weight' attribute on edges for algorithms)
   > Merged matrix_remove_node with network_remove_node function
   > Model now supports multiple attributes, but will require manual entry/documentation (i.e. function to calculate a total 'weight' based on all attributes before sending to algorithms)
   > Slightly modified comment wording for clarity
   > Added comments on uncommented blocks

Todo:
 - Allow parameters for file I/O rather than manual entry
 - Add user input error checks before performing any initialization or calculations
