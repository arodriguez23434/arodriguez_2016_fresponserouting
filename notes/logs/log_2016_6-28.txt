Updates:
 - Modified log naming schema (log_M-D-Y.txt -> log_YYYY_MM-DD.txt)
 - Corrected edge error message to show problematic edge
 - Converted tuples in nodeAttr, nodeNeighbors and nodePos to lists for mutability. 
   > Note: Path matrix keys (and thus, pathDesired) are still tuples since the keys themselves should be immutable and only require operations involving new keys added altogether or removed entirely
 - Stylized graph
   > Added coloration to nodes in path
   > Made nodes squares rather than circles
 - Configured graph to according to our model
 - Placed formal operations under a "main" function that is called only if user checks pass

Notes:
 - NetworkX has only basic graphing functionality for analysis; extended functionality will require another library or software visualization
   > Background unavailable other than simple coloration
   > Node scaling can only done at 1:1 ratio
