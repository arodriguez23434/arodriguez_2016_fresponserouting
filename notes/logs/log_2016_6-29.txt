Updates:
 - Added additional information to check_user_input print
   > IndexError for netNodeAttr
   > TypeError for netNodeNeighbors
 - Added ability to load from Excel workbook file
   > In Sheet 1, A2 = Start Node (for path), B2 = End Node (for path)
   > In Sheet 1, A4 to AX = Node key, B4 to BX = X coordinate, C4 to CX = Y coordinate, D and further down reserved for additional attributes
   > In Sheet 2, columns A and B are nodes that are neighbors to each other 
 - Updated graph output
   > Resized image to 10in x 10in
 - Updated syllabus to reflect progress
 - Updated readme
   > Included section on file I/O
   > Included section on interpreting additional attributes
   > Included section on adding/removing nodes mid-operation

Todo:
 - Add additional attributes to nodes/path
 - Add map background to figure
 - Complete in-line todos in both files

Potential Ventures:
 - Swap from matPlotLib to vizGraph or other graphical library for output
 - Work an edgeAttr dictionary into model
 - Directed graphs (for specific routes) or MultiGraphs (for 2-lane roads)
 - Add functionality for determining real distances from model
   > Update excel spreadsheet to reflect this
   > Update graph labels to according to these distances
   > If possible, make a function for calculating time of travel as well
