Updates:
 - Renamed NetworkX test from test_networkx_undir_graph.py to prototype_undir_graph.py
 - Moved src folder to main directory
 - Converted syllabus to plaintext and added to repository
   > Added task of creating robust network model
 - First iteration of robust network model
   > Function declaration in func_network_operations.py
   > Main file as main_matrix_model.py
   > Built off of prototype with full commenting and corrected organization
   > Network formed by dictionary of nodes with individual attributes and dictionary of all possible paths and associated attributes (more information in comments)

Issues:
 - Shortest path algorithm not properly functioning

Todo:
 - Allow parameters for file I/O rather than manual entry
 - Add user input error checks before performing any initialization or calculations
 - Expand model to include multiple attributes rather than simply concerning distances
 - Explain model more clearly and concisely than simple scattered comments
