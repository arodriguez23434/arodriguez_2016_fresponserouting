Challenges:
    -end nodes of the mapped out routes (particularly baseball field and milican hall) were either not publicly accessible (buses only) or on a sidewalk rather than a road (baseball field)
    -measurement process added extra time due to public parking/necessity to start/stop stopwatch in a safe, non-traffic obstructing area (first response teams can simply stop right at the building/front entrance)
    -traffic and stoplights varied as the day continued
    -daycare required detour to Libra garage (daycare to baseball field route) due to construction
    
Important Notes:
    -routes involving left turns often take longer than routes involving right turns
    -areas of rougher terrain (daycare during construction, lake claire) require slower travel and thus cause more delays
    -placement/value of speed limit signs further influence time
 
For Future Editing:
    -Milican Hall must be split into two nodes
    -Move daycare node on map to be more eastbound and along Libra Dr
    -Baseball field has three potential nodes for parking, or can be kept as-is for sake of simplicity
    
Progress:
    -Obtained 10 measurements for Baseball-Lake Claire, 9 Measurements for Baseball-Daycare, and 1 measurement for Daycare-Milican.
