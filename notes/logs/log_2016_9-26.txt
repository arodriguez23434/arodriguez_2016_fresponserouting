Todo:
- Research prior studies for fuel costs and approach to related problems 
   > Replace fuel cost calculation formula with more accurate measurements from these studies
   > Base analysis on any particularly notable parameters determined from these studies
- Replace placeholder elevations with values from a recent topographical map
