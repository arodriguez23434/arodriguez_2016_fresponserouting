Updates:
- Updated re-fueling process to account for interrupted re-fueling
- Fixed an issue where fuel could exceed maximum capacity
- Fixed an issue where reported fuel remaining would be showing for previous run rather than current status
- Updated fuel consumption formula to be in line with literature
- User now prompted to confirm or deny a recommendation
  > If recommendation denied, user will manually enter next location of vehicle and program will suggest route accordingly
  > Defaults to fastest route if user manually enters next location
  > Report now displays predicted amount of energy recharged and energy remaining after recharge
- Current time is now an internal figure and elapsed time for each route is now reported instead
  > De-sync too likely due to recommendation versus reality
  > Too cumbersome to have user manually enter the time of day and 'true' elapsed time for each route
- Overhauled func_relationship_graphing to now support sensitivity analysis output
  > Previous file now renamed to func_relationship_graphing_old
  > Sensitivity analysis figure saved as files/sensitivity1.png
  > Analysis performed at program end
  
Todo:
- Replace placeholder elevations with values from a recent topographical map
- Fix sensitivity analysis for fuel cost relationship (causes IDE to hang)
- Additional sensitivity analysis
  > Currently performs it based on average; raw values makes an unreadable/too-clumped-together graph
  > One based on variation, one based on range, one based on highest/lowest value
- Finalize results and compile report
- Reflect results of report onto poster
