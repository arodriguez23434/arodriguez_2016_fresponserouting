Updates:
- Added map background and moved nodes accordingly
- Removed nodeNeighbors from config and added edgeAttr
  > Key is Node1,Node2; X = Obstructed, Y = List of Times
- Modified EXCEL format 
  > Worksheet 1
    o Modified Columns B & C to be specific to grid/display
    o Columns D and E now reserved for real world coordinates
  > Worksheet 2
    o Row 1 has entries Node1,Node2 (key of PathMatrix)
    o Row 2 indicates whether the edge is obstructed (boolean)
    o Rows 3+ is time data entries in seconds
- Modified file_excel_interpret to obtain nodeNeighbors from Sheet 2 Row 1 and create edgeAttr from Sheet 2
- Added numRuns to configuration (# of iterations for a particular program run)
- edgeAttr and numRuns added to check_user_input
- Overhauled calc_edge_weights for time consideration and multiple iterations
  > Mean and standard deviations of edge times in edgeAttr stored as variables
  > Now generates a list of sample times (index count = numRun) from mean and std. dev. using numpy.random.normal (Gaussian Noise)
  > Factors obstructions into edges (weight = 999999 if True)
  > Now has attributes 'weight_list' and 'time_list' formed from generated list of times
- Modified get_shortest_path_info for multiple iterations
  > Now obtains total 'weight' from the edges on the path instead of dist and return that as info[0] 
  > Also obtains total 'time' from edges on path and return that as info[2] and total 'distance' as info[3]
- Modified matrix_create for multiple iterations
  > Now iterates over numRuns and sets 'weight' = 'weight_list'[iter] for each path consideration
  > Stores both best path from all iterations as well as all considered paths into pathMatrix[key][0] and pathMatrix[key][1] respectively  
- Graph now displays best path from multiple iterations, travel time on that path, distance on that path, and number of iterations performed

Todo:
 - Modify network_add_node and network_remove_node 
   > Account for edgeAttr
   > Account for numRuns
   > Modify example calls accordingly
 - inputs.txt
   > Make lists of origins and destinations and have user pick/comment out 
   > Number of iterations in file
   > Whether to output/log data T/F
- Handle obstructed edges more cleanly (currently just sets weight to 999999)
   > If edge is obstructed, set color to red
 - Update syllabus to reflect changes
 - Update syllabus to include report desired by EXCEL
