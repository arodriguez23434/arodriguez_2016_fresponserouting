Updates:
- Updated network_add_node and network_remove_node to new edgeAttr and numRuns format
  > Updated examples to be more in line with new format
- Migrated internals of matrix_create to a matrix_iter function for more efficient matrix rebuilding (used in network_remove_node)
- Fixed issue where edges where displaying incorrect weights (displayed the numRun-th iteration instead of the iteration used in the desired path)
- Added elevation as a node attribute
- Added configuration variable: obstructChance
  > Global chance of a particular road being obstructed
  > Can be later replaced a list of obstruction chances for each road that can defined by the spreadsheet rather than a row of booleans
- Added configuration variable: testFor
  > Determines what % of a key variable (time, distance, elevation) should be considered in weight determination
  > Useful for forming hypotheses
  > Can be transitioned into a weightConsideration variable and use testFor for statistical analysis if necessary
- Added numRuns, testFor and obstructionChance to be read from spreadsheet
  > file_excel_interpret now returns a list called fileInfo that contains the changed data
- Added preliminary function for determining fuel cost along an edge
  > Formula is entirely placeholder
  > Used in get_shortest_path_info for total fuel cost as path attribute

Potential Venture:
- Create scatter plots that compare fuel consumption with key variables (time, distance, elevation) as a way of demonstrating significance of each factor

Todo:
- Replace placeholder elevations with values from a recent topographical map
- Replace fuel cost calculation formula with more accurate measurements
- Update syllabus to reflect all current changes
- Update syllabus to include report desired by EXCEL
- Create inputs.txt (see log_2016_7-7)
