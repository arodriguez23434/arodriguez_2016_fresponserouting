"""
Operational Overview:
o Three fundamental dictionaries: nodeAttr, nodePos, pathMatrix
 - nodeAttr's keys are the node names and attributes are tuples containing (x,y)
  position as well as any other attributes in z, w, etc.
 - nodePos is a copy of nodeAttr that only has 2D tuples of physical position
  as its parameters (used for NetworkX graphing inputs)
 - pathMatrix contains a list of all possible paths to and from every node.
   Its keys are tuples of two nodes and its attributes are currently distance
   and the path taken. More attributes can be added later on.
o Using this and a list of connected nodes called nodeNeighbors, the graph
  is built with calculated distances for all possible shortest paths.
o A pathDesired tuple between two nodes is used to reference these dictionaries
  to build a graph displaying the shortest path.
  - There is support for adding and removing entire nodes from the network
  - Both attaining the shortest path desired and adding/removing nodes does not
    require the entire network to be rebuilt due to the nature of dictionaries.
