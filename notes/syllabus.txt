Summer/Fall 2016 URE Agenda
---
Primary Objective: Build a flexible model to simulate performance of vehicles under assumption of an entirely electric fleet.
---
Summer 2016
- Setup GitHub page for project
- Obtain necessary APIs and libraries for model
  o Experiment with capabilities of these tools
    > Simple function calls and inputs
- NetworkX
  o Develop simplified "shortest path" model to testing capabilities of library
  o Create a robust network "matrix" in order to store various parameters for edges; focus only shortest path distance for time being

- Google Maps
  o Focus primarily on obtaining road data
    > Understand various output formats
  o Create over-simplified test routing model
    > Simple "branching paths" linear model to same destination
    > Understand decision-making functionality in particular
    > Intended as a non-flexible test for learning tools 

- Build simplified decision-making model for a closed circuit path
  o Maintain flexibility in function definition
- Ensure simplified model has proper error-checking
- Introduce file I/O to model for simplified testing and updating
- Have graph output be presentable at any given time
  > Ensure readability and large enough size
  > Save output to file

- End Goal 1: Extend model to fit current schematic
  o Employs two circuits connected by a node
  o Randomized destination location
  o Add time limit to route and have model predict whether or not it could reach the destination in time
  o Ensure some sort of graphical output can be provided
- End Goal 2: Implement Google Maps roads into model
  o Implement multiple destinations
  o Automate the process of node placement, if possible
    > If not, ensure node placement matches with static road data
  o Ensure routing is consistent with static road data
- End Goal 3: If time permits, extend model to include resource consumption on trip
  o Arbitrary resource for easy calculations and testing
    > Ensure functions defined for these can later on include other functions for more complex calculations
  o Decision-making process must change according to resource count
    > Low resource should force route to cycle back to the station before continuing
Fall 2016
- If either End Goal 2 or End Goal 3 from Summer was not attained, perform actions to reach them first
- Add resource replenishing stations to the model & test decision-making from there
- Convert resource arbitration to electricity; include engine consumption for electricity assuming a constant speed
- Refine model to include stoplights (energy consumed will be less when stopped but still consuming; model must make accurate prediction while accounting for total time stalled en route)
- Include multiple vehicles into the model
- Ideally, integrate call frequency data into model and vary destination by where these calls would likely occur and how frequently they would occur
- Optional Refinements (Ideal, not required):
  o Elevation data (more energy consumed uphill than downhill)
  o Traffic data (moving obstacles + necessity to stop)
  o Multiple fire stations
- End Goal: Place into presentable poster and paper format
  o Paper format can explain the process of the model's creation
  o Poster format however should just visualize and describe the model itself
  o Paper format should showcase results of time study + energy efficiency with quantative data
  o Poster format should showcase summarized version of results with emphasis on why they're important
