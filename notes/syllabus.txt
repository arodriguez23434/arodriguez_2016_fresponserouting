Summer/Fall 2016 URE Agenda
---
Primary Objective: Build a flexible model to simulate performance of vehicles under assumption of an entirely electric fleet.
---
Summer 2016
- Setup GitHub page for project
- Obtain necessary APIs and libraries for model
  o Experiment with capabilities of these tools
    > Simple function calls and inputs
- NetworkX
  o Develop simplified "shortest path" model to testing capabilities of library
  o Create a robust network "matrix" in order to store various parameters for edges; focus only shortest path distance for time being
- Build simplified decision-making model for a closed circuit path
  o Maintain flexibility in function definition
  o Allow nodes to be added and removed after model is created
- Ensure simplified model has proper error-checking
- Have graph output be presentable at any given time
  o Ensure readability and large enough size
  o Save output to file
- Fit schematic to model
  o Employ two circuits connected by a node
  o Have seperate variables for real positions versus projected 
positions
- Introduce file I/O to model for simplified testing and updating
  o Excel Spreadsheet which can be read and updated easily
  o inputs.txt file to allow user to comment out and remove comments for simulation preferences
    > Use for both purpose of model configuration as well as testing specific inputs/outputs
- Output measured weights, determined path and all relevant inputs
  o Primary inputs: Distance, Time, and Elevation
  o If available, include secondary inputs such as weight of consideration for these variables or number of iterations performed
- Extend model to include resource consumption on trip
  o Arbitrary resource for easy calculations and testing
    > Ensure functions defined for these can later on include other functions for more complex calculations
  o Decision-making process must change according to resource count
    > Low resource should force route to cycle back to the station before continuing
- Draft, revise and submit a research letter regarding the project, its goals, its parameters, current function and future tasks
- Create a 230-250 approved abstract as required by EXCEL Program

Fall 2016
- Provide relevant graphical outputs to show relationship and importance of particular inputs to resulting trip
- Clean up code, verify/add to documentation and ensure robustness of model
  o Remove any obsolete modules or functions
  o Repair or realign old functions to suit needs of new functions
  o Test model under entirely different geographical conditions and different parameters
  o Fix any known issues in current form
- Improve formulas utilized for calculating distance and elevation between nodes based on literature review
  o May require heightmap or elevation data input for accuracy
- Improve fuel calculations based on findings in literature review
- Convert deterministic model to probabilistic, continuously running model
- Implement recommendations based on call frequency data and current vehicle status
  o Call frequency data provided by Fire Station 65 (2015 data)
  o Consider how much fuel is left and determine whether a recharge is necessary before further response
  o Recommend whether or not a fuel-efficient path is feasible or if the quickest path should be taken
  o Provide report for each route on what is recommended and the risks involved with using that recommendation
- Refine relevant graphical outputs to be adapted with any changes in the model and necessary data to be reported
- Ensure all calculations and methods are verifiable with literature reviewed
- Ideally, implement Google Maps roads into model
  o Learn input and output formats provided by API
  o Map road data to local positions
  o Automate the process of node placement, if possible
    > If not, ensure node placement matches with static road data
  o Ensure routing is consistent with static road data
    > Can be approximated/simplified rather than exact
- If precision is required for routing, create "sub-node" system between major nodes
  o Pathing calculations based on iterating through these sub-node trails
    > All functionally NetworkX node types, but defined as separate dictionaries for all other purposes
    > Associate sub-node list with a tuple/list of two nodes; dictionary can be used for this purpose
  o If simplistic model is preferred, ignore this step
- End Goal #1: Approved technical report
  o Explain the process of the model's creation
  o Demonstrate foundational knowledge and cite from literature review throughout
  o Showcase results with quantitative data
  o Extrapolate on usefulness of analyzed data and how this can be implemented in future models/iterations
- End Goal #2: Draft and approve 75% of poster design
  o Poster format however should just visualize and describe the model and its purpose
  o Showcase summarized version of results with emphasis on how their current usefulness and potential future prospects
