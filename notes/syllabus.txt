Summer/Fall 2016 URE Agenda
---
Primary Objective: Build a flexible model to simulate performance of vehicles under assumption of an entirely electric fleet.
---
Summer 2016
- Setup GitHub page for project
- Obtain necessary APIs and libraries for model
  o Experiment with capabilities of these tools
    > Simple function calls and inputs
- NetworkX
  o Develop simplified "shortest path" model to testing capabilities of library
  o Create a robust network "matrix" in order to store various parameters for edges; focus only shortest path distance for time being
- Build simplified decision-making model for a closed circuit path
  o Maintain flexibility in function definition
  o Allow nodes to be added and removed after model is created
- Ensure simplified model has proper error-checking
- Have graph output be presentable at any given time
  o Ensure readability and large enough size
  o Save output to file
- Fit schematic to model
  o Employ two circuits connected by a node
  o Have seperate variables for real positions versus projected 
positions
- Introduce file I/O to model for simplified testing and updating
  o EXCEL Spreadsheet which can be read and updated easily
  o inputs.txt file to allow user to comment out and remove comments for simulation preferences
    > Use for both purpose of model configuration as well as testing specific inputs/outputs
- Output measured weights, determined path and all relevant inputs
  o Primary inputs: Distance, Time, and Elevation
  o If available, include secondary inputs such as weight of consideration for these variables or number of iterations performed
- Extend model to include resource consumption on trip
  o Arbitrary resource for easy calculations and testing
    > Ensure functions defined for these can later on include other functions for more complex calculations
  o Decision-making process must change according to resource count
    > Low resource should force route to cycle back to the station before continuing
- Draft, revise and submit a research letter regarding the project, its goals, its parameters, current function and future tasks
- Create a 230-250 approved abstract as required by EXCEL

Fall 2016
- Improve formulas utilized for calculating distance and elevation between nodes
   o May require heightmap or elevation data input for accuracy
- Provide relevant graphical outputs to show relationship and importance of particular inputs to resulting trip
- Convert resource arbitration to electricity; include engine consumption for electricity assuming a constant speed
- Refine model to include stoplights (energy consumed will be less when stopped but still consuming; model must make accurate prediction while accounting for total time stalled en route)
- Ideally, integrate call frequency data into model and vary destination by where these calls would likely occur and how frequently they would occur
- Implement Google Maps roads into model, if possible
  o Focus primarily on obtaining road data
    > Understand various output formats
  o Create over-simplified test routing model
    > Simple "branching paths" linear model to same destination
    > Understand decision-making functionality in particular
    > Intended as a non-flexible test for learning tools 
  o Implement multiple destinations
  o Automate the process of node placement, if possible
    > If not, ensure node placement matches with static road data
  o Ensure routing is consistent with static road data
- End Goal #1: Approved technical report
  o Explain the process of the model's creation
  o Showcase results with quantative data
  o Extrapolate on usefulness of analyzed data and how this can be impelmented in future models/iterations
- End Goal #2: Draft and approve 75% of poster design
  o Poster format however should just visualize and describe the model and its purpose
  o Showcase summarized version of results with emphasis on how their current usefulness and potential future prospects
