Summer/Fall 2016 URE Agenda
---
Primary Objective: Build a flexible model to simulate performance of vehicles under assumption of an entirely electric fleet.
---
Summer 2016
-Setup GitHub page for project
-Obtain necessary APIs and libraries for model
	oExperiment with capabilities of these tools
		>Simple function calls and inputs
-NetworkX
	oDevelop simplified "shortest path" model to testing capabilities of library
	oCreate a robust network "matrix" in order to store various parameters for edges; focus only shortest path distance for time being

-Google Maps
	oFocus primarily on obtaining road data
		>Understand various output formats
	oCreate over-simplified test routing model
		>Simple "branching paths" linear model to same destination
		>Understand decision-making functionality in particular
		>Intended as a non-flexible test for learning tools 
-Build simplified decision-making model for a closed circuit path
	oMaintain flexibility in function definition
-End Goal 1: Extend model to fit current schematic
	oEmploys two circuits connected by a node
	oRandomized destination location
	oAdd time limit to route and have model predict whether or not it could reach the destination in time
	oEnsure some sort of graphical output can be provided
-End Goal 2: Implement Google Maps roads into model
	oImplement multiple destinations
	oAutomate the process of node placement, if possible
		>If not, ensure node placement matches with static road data
	oEnsure routing is consistent with static road data
-End Goal 3: If time permits, extend model to include resource consumption on trip
	oArbitrary resource for easy calculations and testing
		>Ensure functions defined for these can later on include other functions for more complex calculations
	oDecision-making process must change according to resource count
		>Low resource should force route to cycle back to the station before continuing
Fall 2016
-If either End Goal 2 or End Goal 3 from Summer was not attained, perform actions to reach them first
-Add resource replenishing stations to the model & test decision-making from there
-Convert resource arbitration to electricity; include engine consumption for electricity assuming a constant speed
-Refine model to include stoplights (energy consumed will be less when stopped but still consuming; model must make accurate prediction while accounting for total time stalled en route)
-Include multiple vehicles into the model
-Ideally, integrate call frequency data into model and vary destination by where these calls would likely occur and how frequently they would occur
-Optional Refinements (Ideal, not required):
	oElevation data (more energy consumed uphill than downhill)
	oTraffic data (moving obstacles + necessity to stop)
	oMultiple fire stations
-End Goal: Place into presentable poster and paper format
	oPaper format can explain the process of the model's creation
	oPoster format however should just visualize and describe the model itself
	oPaper format should showcase results of time study + energy efficiency with quantative data
	oPoster format should showcase summarized version of results with emphasis on why they're important
